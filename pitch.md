# Clear Smile London - AI Video Content Strategy

## Business Model
- **Clear Smile London** = Educational content platform (not just Dr. Holmes' practice)
- **Purpose**: Build authority through honest Invisalign education, provide trusted authentic guidance
- **Dr. Sarah Holmes**: 25+ years experience, Invisalign provider since 2006, works 2 days/week at Carnaby Street, charges honest £4K for realistic treatment with high chance of success

## Content Strategy: Price Transparency Focus
Target low-competition, high-frustration keywords around Invisalign costs and hidden fees.

## Priority Video Concepts (AI-Generated):

### 1. "Invisalign Cleaning Crystals: Complete Guide"
- **Target**: "invisalign cleaning crystals" (cheap AdWords keyword)
- **Angle**: £50 official crystals vs 80% cheaper alternatives that work just as well
- **Monetization**: Affiliate links, email capture

### 2. "The Shocking Truth About Invisalign Costs"
- **Target**: "shocking invisalign costs", "invisalign hidden fees"
- **Expose**: "From £1,500" is unusual teaser price most people can't use, chain clinic failures, 1000% markup on replacements
- **Insider intel**: Dr. Holmes sees correction cases from chain clinics, i7 often leads to needing full treatment

### 3. "Why This £4K Invisalign Expert Only Works 2 Days a Week"
- **Position**: Dr. Holmes as premium-quality, honest pricing alternative
- **Angle**: Quality over volume, realistic pricing for realistic outcomes
- **Value prop**: 25+ years experience, honest price (not £2K, not £8K), high success rate

## Key Industry Insights (from Dr. Holmes):
- Chain clinics have high failure rates, rush planning phase
- About 40% of her correction cases come from chain clinics
- Most "£2,000 Invisalign" ads only apply to small percentage of patients
- Hidden costs (premium retainers, refinements, replacements) often double final price

## AI Video Production:
- Use Runway ML/Pika Labs for realistic scenes
- Create consistent Dr. Holmes character for authority
- 3-10 minute educational videos
- Multiple formats: YouTube long-form, social media cuts

## Monetization Path:
1. **Immediate**: Affiliate commissions on cleaning products/alternatives
2. **Medium**: Email list building via free "cost calculator" and "hidden fees checklist"
3. **Long-term**: When viewers need treatment, they seek out honest providers like Dr. Holmes

## Competitive Advantage:
Position Clear Smile London as the trusted authentic guide willing to tell the truth about Invisalign, making Dr. Holmes the obvious choice when people want honest pricing and realistic expectations.
